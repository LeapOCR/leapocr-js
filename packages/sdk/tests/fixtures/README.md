# Test Fixtures

This directory contains sample files used for testing the LeapOCR SDK.

## Files

- `sample.pdf` - Simple PDF file containing "Hello World" text
- `sample.png` - 1x1 transparent PNG image

## Usage

These files are used by both unit and integration tests. Do not modify or delete these files as they are required for the test suite to run correctly.

## Creating Additional Fixtures

If you need additional test files:

1. Add them to this directory
2. Document them in this README
3. Use appropriate file sizes (keep fixtures small)
4. Ensure files are valid format examples
